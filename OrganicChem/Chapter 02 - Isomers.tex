	\section{Overview}

	Isomers are molecules that share the same structural formula, yet exist in different forms. The two main
	forms of isomerism are structural isomerism and stereoisomerism. In both cases, the molecular formula is the same,
	while the chemical and physical properties may differ greatly.

	\section{Structural Isomerism}

		\subsection{Chain Isomerism}

			In chain isomerism, molecules have the same functional groups, except the carbon skeleton is different. Chain isomers typically
			have similar chemical properties, but different physical properties (since the shape of the carbon chain can determine the
			strength of id-id interactions).

			}[Pentanol and 3-methylbutan-1-ol are chain isomers.]

		\subsection{Positional Isomerism}
			Positional isomers have the same arrangement of their carbon chains, and the same functional groups. However, said
			functional groups are placed at different positions.

			\diagram[1.0]{
				\chemfig{!\molMeR-[:-30](-[:270]!\molOH)-[:30](-[:90]!\molOH)-[:-30]-[:30]!\molMe}\hspace{10mm}

			}[Butan-2,3-ol and butan-2,4-ol are positional isomers.]

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Functional Group Isomerism}
			This is somewhat a misnomer since it is exactly the opposite of what it seems to intuit. Functional group isomers
			share only their molecular formulas; the carbon chain, the functional groups, etc. are all different.

			}[Propanal and acetone are functional group isomers.]

	\section{Stereoisomerism}

		Stereoisomers of molecules have the same structure and functional groups, but those groups are arranged in a spatially
		differing way. The main forms of stereoisomerism are cis/trans (or E/Z) isomerism, and optical isomerism.

		Note that for certain cis/trans (E/Z) isomers, the trans (or E) variant can \enquote{pack} better, resulting in a higher melting
		point. This doesn't affect the boiling point since the molecules are too far apart in the gaseous phase for it to matter.

		Additionally, the presence of \itl{intramolecular} (within the same molecule) hydrogen bonds can also be a factor since
		it reduces the strength of \itl{intermolecular} hydrogen bonds. Other than these, the chemical and physical properties of
		stereoisomers are mostly the same.


		% this puts the "cis/trans isomerism" chapter on the next page, so as not to split the image.

		\subsection{Cis/Trans Isomerism}

			Only alkenes can exhibit cis-trans isomerism, due to the \ch{C=C} bond that restricts rotation along its axis. This is because
			of the $\pi$-bonds that only bond at 180Â° intervals. At these positions, it forms the cis and trans isomers.

			\diagram[1.2]{
				\chemfig{C(-[:135]H)(-[:225]!\molRon)=C(-[:45]!\molRtw)(-[:315]H)}		\hspace{15mm}
				\chemfig{C(-[:135]H)(-[:225]!\molRon)=C(-[:45]H)(-[:315]!\molRtw)}
			}

			The molecule on the left is the \itl{trans} isomer while the one on the right is the \itl{cis} isomer. \itl{trans}
			is from Latin, meaning \itl{other side}, while \itl{cis} obviously means \itl{same side}. In the former,
			the larger groups are on opposite sides of the alkene double bond, while in the latter, the larger groups are on the same
			side.

			When naming cis/trans isomers, the qualifier \itl{cis} or \itl{trans} is placed before the stem name, like so:
			\begin{bulletlist}
				& cis-but-2-ene
				& trans-but-2-ene
			\end{bulletlist}

			Note that cis/trans isomerism is not applicable to molecules where identical groups are attached to the any one carbon atom,
			since there is a line of symmetry going along the plane of the double bond.


			\diagram[1.2]{
				\chemfig{C(-[:135]H)(-[:225]H)=C(-[:45]!\molRon)(-[:315]!\molRtw)}
			}

		\subsection{E/Z Isomerism}

			E/Z is the more comprehensive, general form of cis/trans. Consider the alkene below, with two variants
			due to the lack of a plane of symmetry:

			\diagram[1.2]{
				\chemfig{C(-[:135]!\molCl)(-[:225]!\molF)=C(-[:45]!\molMe)(-[:315]!\molBr)}		\hspace{15mm}
				\chemfig{C(-[:135]!\molCl)(-[:225]!\molF)=C(-[:45]!\molBr)(-[:315]!\molMe)}
			}

			It has 4 distinct substituents, and thus a cis/trans designation cannot be used. Behold, E/Z isomerism. At its core, it
			is simply another method of handling alkene isomers that works more generally.

			It follows a scheme of priorities (Cahn-Ingold-Prelog, or CIP), which are determined as such:
			\begin{romanlist}
				& The group with the largest atomic mass \itl{directly attached} to the alkene's carbon has the highest priority.
				& In the event of a tie, look at the atoms directly attached to \itl{that} offending atom. Use the previous
				  rule, favouring higher priority atoms, to tiebreak. Double bonds are counted twice.
				& Recursively evaluate the previous rule with attached atoms, to continue the tiebreaking process.
			\end{romanlist}

			The above scheme should be used to find the two highest-priority groups attached to the alkene, after which, if the two
			groups are attached on the same side of the alkene, then the molecule is the \itl{Z} isomer, and it is known as the
			\itl{E} isomer if the reverse is true.

			E and Z come from the German \itl{entgegen} and \itl{zusammen}, \itl{opposite} and \itl{together}
			respectively.

		\subsection{Optical Isomerism}

			Due to the 3-dimensional tetrahedral nature of a carbon atom, if there are 4 \itl{distinct} substituents, two
			non-superimposable mirror images can exist due to a lack of any plane of symmetry. Such carbons are called
			\itl{chiral carbons}, and are the \itl{chiral centres} of the molecule. A molecule can have multiple chiral
			centres.

			Consider butan-2-ol below. Carbon 2, with the OH group, has 4 different groups attached to it. As such, it is a chiral carbon.

			\diagram{
				\chemfig{H-C(-[:90]H)(-[:270]H)-C(-[:90]H)(-[:270]!\molOH)-C(-[:90]H)(-[:270]H)-C(-[:90]H)(-[:270]H)-H}
			}

			Indeed, it can take the form of 2 non-superimposable mirror images, that are differentiated by the adjacency of 2 of
			the 4 groups bonded to the chiral carbon. As can be seen, these two mirror images cannot be rearranged into the other,
			and are distinct --- these are called \itl{enantiomers}. (This can be illustrated using Fleming's Left- and Right- hand rules.)

			\diagram[1.2]{
				\chemfig{C(-[:225]H)(-[:90]!\molEthyl)(<:[:315]!\molOH)(<[:350]!\molMe)}		\hspace{7.5mm}\vdashrule{30mm}\hspace{7.5mm}
				\chemfig{C(-[:315]H)(-[:90]!\molEthyl)(<:[:225]!\molOH)(<[:190]!\molMe)}

			}[The solid wedge shows a bond coming out of the paper, while the dashed wedge goes into the paper.]


			Optical isomers have identical physical properties, except for their treatment of plane-polarised light (this is
			where the light wave is only oscillating along one plane). One of the isomers will rotate this light clockwise, while the
			other will rotate it counterclockwise. The magnitude of both rotations are the same.

			If equal amounts of each enantiomer are present in a solution, it is called a \itl{racemic mixture}, and the net
			rotation of plane polarised light will be 0, for obvious reasons.

			Enantiomers usually have identical chemical properties except for certain reactions that require a specific spatial
			orientation to work, such as proteins, that can only work with one of the optical isomers.
