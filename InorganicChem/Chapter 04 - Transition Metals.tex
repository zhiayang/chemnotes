\part{Transition Metals}

	\section{Overview}

		Transition metals are d-block elements with atoms that have a \itl{partially-filled} d-subshell, or form cations with incomplete
		d-subshells.

		\imgdiagram{80mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/periodic_table_blocks.png}{The d-block is in green.}

		Even though zinc and scandium are in the d-block, they are generally not considered transition metals, and do not exhibit many
		of the typical properties of transition metals.


		\subsection{Electronic Configuration}

			\subsubsection{Atomic Configuration}

				The electronic configurations of the period 4 d-block elements are laid out below. For reference, the electronic configuration
				of argon is 1s\sps{2}2s\sps{2}2p\sps{6}3s\sps{2}3p\sps{6}.

				\tabto{0mm}Scandium (\ch{Sc}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{1}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Titanium (\ch{Ti}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{2}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Vanadium (\ch{V}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{3}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Chromium (\ch{Cr}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{5}4s\sps{1}
				\tabto{0mm}Manganese (\ch{Mn}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{5}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Iron (\ch{Fe}):		\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{6}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Cobalt (\ch{Co}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{7}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Nickel (\ch{Ni}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{8}4s\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}Copper (\ch{Cu}):	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{10}4s\sps{1}
				\tabto{0mm}Zinc (\ch{Zn}):		\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{10}4s\sps{2}


				Note the strange configurations of \ch{Cu} and \ch{Cr}. Instead of having a 3d\sps{4}4s\sps{2} or 3d\sps{9}4s\sps{2} configuration,
				they instead have 3d\sps{5} and 3d\sps{10} configurations. The reason for this is the favourability, or lower energy level, of
				a configuration that minimises electron density.

				Lower electron densities naturally mean less inter-electronic repulsion, which reduces the potential energy of the system and
				making it more stable.

			% end subsubsection


			\subsubsection{Ionic Configuration}

				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Sc^3+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{0}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Ti^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{V^3+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{2}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Cr^3+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{3}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Mn^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{5}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Fe^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{6}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Co^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{7}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Ni^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{8}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Cu^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{9}
				\tabto{0mm}\ch{Zn^2+}:	\tabto{35mm}[\ch{Ar}] 3d\sps{10}

				Note how the 2 electrons in the 4s-subshell are lost first. The reason for this behaviour is due to the energy levels of the
				electron shells. The filling order proceeds in this manner:

				\imgdiagram{70mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/electron_filling.png}{\vspace{-1em}}

				The empty 4s subshell has a lower energy than the empty 3d subshell, so it is filled first. However, once the 4s subshell is
				filled, electrons go to the 3d subshell --- the addition of electrons eventually lowers the energy level of the 3d subshell
				below that of the 4s.

				Hence, when removing electrons, the ones in the 4s subshell, which is now at a higher energy level than the 3d subshell, are the
				first to go.

				Furthermore, from the configurations above it can be seen that \ch{Sc^3+} only has an empty 3d-subshell, while \ch{Zn^2+} has
				a fully-filled 3d-subshell. Thus, they are not considered transition metals.

	\section{Physical Properties}

		\subsection{Atomic Radii}

			Generally speaking, the atomic radii across the transition metals remains relatively constant. Physically speaking, the 4s electrons
			are the valence electrons; hence, since new electrons are added to the 3d subshell, the increase in the shielding effect
			somewhat mitigates the increase in nuclear charge.


			\imgdiagram{100mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/atomic_radii.png}{\vspace{-1em}}


			Hence, the atomic radii remains relatively constant across the d-block elements. Comparing with potassium and calcium,
			the radii of d-block elements are \itl{much smaller} than the radii of s-block elements. This is due to the fact that the shielding
			effect of the 3d-subshell is quite poor due to its \itl{diffuse nature}.

			Thus, the increase in nuclear charge from \ch{Ca} to \ch{Sc} without a correspondingly significant change in the shielding effect
			leads to a sharp decrease in atomic radius by virtue of being able to attract the valence electrons closer to the nucleus.

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Melting and Boiling Points}

			There is no singular trend, but generally speaking the melting and boiling points for the transition elements are all higher
			than the s-block metals. This is due to the increased number of electrons available for metallic bonding --- transition
			metals can use both the 3d and 4s electrons, due to the small difference in their energy levels.

			From vanadium to manganese however, there is a decrease in melting and boiling points, which is due to the stability of the
			singly-filled 3d-subshell (5 electrons out of 10, all with the same spin), which reduces their availability for metallic bonding.

			Somewhat similarly, from iron to zinc, the melting and boiling points start to decrease, as paired electrons are again less
			available for bonding.

		% end subsection


		\subsection{First Ionisation Energy}

			The trend for the first IE. is somewhat similar to the trend for atomic radii. For s- and p-block elements, additional electrons
			do not contribute significantly to the shielding effect as they are added to the valence shell. Hence, with an increasing nuclear
			charge, it becomes more difficult to remove a valence electron.

			\imgdiagram{100mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/first_ie.png}

			In contrast, electrons are added to the inner 3d-subshell across the transition elements, leading to an increase in the shielding
			effect. Thus mostly negates the increasing nuclear charge, since the valence electron, which is the one being removed, is in the
			4s-subshell.

			Hence, first IE. increases only \itl{slightly} across the transition metals.

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Other things}

			Other than the 3 main trends, transition metals are generally denser than s-block metals, mostly due to their increased atomic
			mass and smaller atomic radii.

			Furthermore, they are generally better conductors (lower resistance) due to the larger number of delocalised electrons.

		% end subsection

	\section{Chemical Properties}

		\subsection{Variable Oxidation States}

			The primary reason for transition metals having variable oxidation states is the relatively small difference in energy levels
			of the 3d and 4s subshells. Thus, once the 4s electrons are removed, not much more energy is needed to start removing electrons
			from the 3d subshell.

			Conversely, for s-block metals, the next subshell to remove electrons from would be the p-subshell, which is at a far higher
			energy level, and hence is not easily removed --- thus s-block metals tend to only have one oxidation state, the one where all the
			4s electrons are removed.

			Generally speaking, the 2+ ion is usually more stable than the 3+ ion, due to the need to remove an extra electron. Iron is an
			exception here, due to the existence of 6 electrons in its 3d subshell, with 1 electron pair and 4 unpaired electrons, which
			is less stable than having 5 unpaired electrons; hence \ch{Fe^3+} is more stable than \ch{Fe^2+}.

			\subsubsection{Trends in Oxidation States}

				Across the period, the number of possible oxidation states increases, and peaks at manganese (having up to +7), before
				decreasing back to +2 in zinc.

				The reason for the first part in the trend is attributable to the increasing number of 3d electrons, all of which can be
				removed or involved in bonding to increase the oxidation state. Hence, manganese, with 5 electrons in the 3d-subshell and 2
				in the 4s-subshell, can have 7 electrons removed, or involved in bonding (typically the latter)

				In the second half, electrons in the d-subshell start pairing up, reducing the possible number of electrons that can participate
				in covalent bonding, hence the number of possible oxidation states decrease.

			% end subsubsection

			\subsubsection{Bonding in Various Oxidation States}

				Transition metals at relatively low oxidation states, from +1 to +3, typically exist as ions, and form ionic solids. In this
				respect they behave like normal s-block metals. For example, \ch{Fe\Cl3}, \ch{CuSO4} have \ch{Fe^3+} and \ch{Cu^2+} ions.

				However, at higher oxidation states, it is unstable to have exposed ions with high charge, so the transition metals at such
				high oxidation states are typically \itl{covalently bonded} (yes, that's right) with oxygen, forming covalent molecules or
				oxy-anions. Examples include \ch{MnO4-} and \ch{Cr2O7^2-}.

			% end subsubsection

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Catalytic Properties}

			\subsubsection{Heterogeneous Catalysis}

				The main reason transition metals are able to act as heterogeneous catalysts is due to the presence of a \itl{partially-filled}
				d-subshell. This allows them to either \itl{accept} electron pairs, or \itl{donate} electron pairs, allowing for the adsorption
				of reactant molecules onto their surface.

				The detailed mechanism is covered elsewhere, but suffice to say this ability to accept or donate electrons can weaken the bonds
				in the reactant, lowering the activation energy.

				Some examples of heterogeneous catalysts include:

				\begin{bulletlist}
					& Finely divided \ch{Fe} powder, \itl{Haber Process}:	\tabto{70mm}\ch{3 H2 + N2 -> 2 NH3}
					& \ch{V2O5}, \itl{Contact Process}:						\tabto{70mm}\ch{2 SO2 + O2 -> 2 SO3}
					& Nickel, \itl{Reduction of Alkenes}:					\tabto{70mm}\ch{RCH=CH2 + H2 -> RCH2CH3}
				\end{bulletlist}

			% end subsubsection



			\subsubsection{Homogeneous Catalysis}

				The ability for transition metals to act as homogeneous catalysts is due to an entirely different reason; it is a result
				of the ease of converting between different oxidation states. This is often useful when there is a need to react
				two negatively-charged ions --- the transition metal ion can act as an intermediary.

				A common example is the oxidation of \ch{I-} to \ch{I2} by \ch{S2O8^2-}.

				\txtdiagram{
					\schemestart[0, 1.5, thick]
						\ch{2 Fe^2+} + \ch{S2O8^2-}\arrow{->[\tinytext{Step 1}]}\ch{2 Fe^3+} + \ch{2 SO4^2-}
						\arrow(@c1.south east--.north east){0}[-90,.35]
						\ch{2 Fe^3+} + \ch{2 I-}\arrow{->[\tinytext{Step 2}]}\ch{I2} + \ch{Fe^2+}
						\arrow(@c3.south east--.north east){0}[-90,.35]
						\ch{S2O8^2-} + \ch{2 I-}\arrow{->[\tinytext{Overall}]}\ch{I2} + \ch{2 SO4^2-}
					\schemestop
				}{\vspace{-1em}}

				Here, the \ch{Fe^2+} ion and the \ch{S2O8^2-} ion can easily react, because they are oppositely charged. \ch{Fe^2+} is
				oxidised by the peroxodisulphate ion to \ch{Fe^3+}, forming one of the products, \ch{SO4^2-}.

				The \ch{Fe^3+} produced then proceeds to oxidise the \ch{I-} ion, forming the other product, \ch{I2}, and regenerating
				the \ch{Fe^2+} catalyst.

				Without the catalyst, the need to react two negatively charged ions directly (\ch{S2O8^2-} and \ch{I-}) would lead to an
				abysmal rate of reaction.

				Note that the order of the two sub-reactions is irrelevant, so \ch{Fe^3+} can be used as the catalyst as well.

	\section{Complexes}

		\subsection{Overview}

			A complex consists of a central metal atom or cation, datively-bonded to surrounding ligands, which are anions or molecules with
			at least one lone pair.

			While all metal cations can form complexes, transition metals form them more readily than other metals. This is due to their
			relatively higher charge density than s-block metals (smaller atomic radius, with similar or higher nuclear charge), as well
			as empty orbitals for dative bonding.

			Note that aluminium fulfils both of these criteria, and expectedly forms complex ions; \ch{[\Al(OH)4]-} and the hydrated ion
			\ch{[\Al(H2O)6]^3+} are examples. The \ch{\Al^3+} ion has entirely empty 3s-, 3p-, and 3d-subshells, which can accept electron
			pairs from ligands.

			In transition metals as well as aluminium for instance, empty subshells are typically \itl{hybridised} into identical orbitals with
			the same energy levels; aluminium hybridises the 3s, 3p, and 3d subshells, while transition metals typically can hybridise the
			4s, 4p, and 4d subshells as well.

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Ligand Dentateness}

			While a fair number of ligands are monodentate, ie. they form a single dative bond with the central atom, there are also a number
			of \itl{polydentate} ligands, forming more than one dative bond.

			\paragraph{Monodentate Ligands}

EDTA)}
			}

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Complex Charges}

			Ironically it is not very complex to determine the charge of a complex; simply sum the oxidation number of the central metal atom and
			the ionic charges of the ligands. It is possible to have neutral complexes, either by having balanced charges, or with a neutral
			metal atom and neutral ligands.

			A compound containing a complex ion typically has \itl{counter ions} that serve to balance the charge. In aqueous solution, the
			counter ions dissociate from the complex ion as expected. The complex ion is treated as a \itl{single, polyatomic ion}.

		% end subsection


		\pagebreak
		\subsection{Coordination Number}

			The coordination number of a complex determines the number of ligands around the central atom, as well as their arrangement around
			the central atom, in a manner similar to VSEPR theory.

		\subsection{Hydrated Complex Ions}

			Otherwise known as aqua complexes, these ions are formed when a transition metal, or any metal with a sufficiently high charge
			density, is dissolved in water. Essentially these are complexes where the water molecules act as ligands.

			In contrast, most s-block metals (eg. sodium) do not form hydrated complexes, only ion-dipole interactions. This is because
			the highly-charged and small transition metal cations have high polarising power, thus preferring the formation of
			covalent bonds versus ionic interactions.


			\pagebreak
			\subsubsection{Hydrolysis of Hydrated Complexes}

				As discussed to death in previous sections, these hydrated complex ions are able to hydrolyse in water to some extent, producing
				\ch{H3O+ \stAq} ions that make the solution acidic.

				This ability is due to the high polarising power of the central cation, which can polarise and weaken \ch{O-H} bonds in the
				water ligand, eventually allowing another water molecule to attack the weakly-attached H atom, forming \ch{H3O+}.


				\txtdiagram{
					\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
						\ch{[Fe(H2O)6]^3+ \stAq}\hspace{2mm} + \hspace{2mm}\ch{H2O \stL}\arrow{<=>}\ch{[Fe(H2O)5OH]^2+ \stAq}\hspace{2mm} + \hspace{2mm}\ch{H3O+ \stAq}
						\arrow(@c1.south east--.north east){0}[-90,.20]

					\schemestop
				}{\vspace{-1.5em}}

			% end subsubsection

			\subsubsection{Cations with High Oxidation States}

				Transition metal cations with very high oxidation states, typically above +3, do not form hydrated complex ions. This is due
				to the extreme polarising power of the ion, which instead completely breaks the \ch{O-H} bonds, favouring the formation of
				oxy-anions.

				As an example, aqueous chromium ions in the +6 oxidation state \itl{do not} exist as \ch{[Cr(H2O)6]^6+}. Instead, it
				forms \ch{CrO4^2-} and \ch{Cr2O7^2-}, chromate and dichromate, which exist in an equilibrium.

				\txtdiagram{
					\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
						\ch{2 CrO4^2- \stAq} + \ch{2 H+ \stAq}\arrow{<=>}\ch{Cr2O7^2- \stAq} + \ch{H2O \stL}
					\schemestop
				}{\vspace{-1.5em}}

				In acidic conditions, [\ch{H+}] is high, so by Le Châtelier's Principle, the position of equilibrium moves to the right,
				favouring the production of orange dichromate. Conversely in an alkaline medium, the position of equilibrium moves to the left
				to favour yellow chromate.

		\subsection{Ligand Exchange}

			Ligand exchange reactions are simply reactions where one or more of the ligands of a complex are replaced by other ligands. That
			is all. The new complex can often have different properties, including reduction potential and colour.

			\subsubsection{Stability Constant, \MKstab{}}

				\Kstab{} is essentially another form of \Kc{} for complex ions. For example, if an exchange between the \ch{H2O} ligands of
				\ch{[Cu(H2O)6]^2+} and \ch{\Cl-} ligands were to happen:

				\txtdiagram{
					\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
						\ch{[Cu(H2O)6]^2+ \stAq} + \ch{4 \Cl- \stAq}\arrow{<=>}\ch{[Cu\Cl4]^2- \stAq} + \ch{6 H2O \stL}
					\schemestop
				}{\vspace{-1.5em}}

				The \Kstab{} equation would be as such:

				\diagram[1.5]{
					\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
						$K_{stab} = \frac{[[CuCl_{4}]^{2-}]}{[[Cu(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}][Cl-]^{4}}$
					\schemestop
				}{\vspace{-1em}}

				The higher the \Kstab{} value, then, the greater the probability that ligand exchange will take place.

			% end subsubsection



			\subsubsection{Effect on Reduction Potential}

				Different ligands can affect the reduction potential of the central metal ion. For instance, \ch{[Fe(H2O)6]^3+} has a reduction
				potential of \SI[retain-explicit-plus]{+0.77}{\volt}, while \ch{[Fe(CN)6]^3-} only has a reduction potential of
				\SI[retain-explicit-plus]{+0.36}{\volt}.

				The difference can be due to steric hindrance, or more likely in the case of \ch{[Fe(CN)6]^3-}, the negative charge of the
				ligands increasing the energy needed for the electron to approach and successfully reduce the \ch{Fe^3+} centre.

			% end subsubsection


			\subsubsection{Ligand Exchange in Haemoglobin}

				Ligand exchange underlies the function of haemoglobin molecules in the blood that transport oxygen to cells. Under normal
				circumstances, the haemoglobin molecule has a central \ch{Fe^2+} ion, and can \itl{reversibly} form dative bonds with \ch{O2}
				molecules, creating \itl{oxyhaemoglobin}.

				When exposed to molecules of \ch{CO} however, oxyhaemoglobin undergoes a ligand exchange reaction, replacing the \ch{O2} ligand
				with a \ch{CO} ligand. Unfortunately, the \Kstab{} value of \itl{carboxyhaemoglobin} is around \itl{\num{210} times} greater
				than oxyhaemoglobin.

				Thus, the ligand exchange reaction is effectively \itl{irreversible}, permanently disabling that molecule of haemoglobin.
				If enough molecules are disabled, death naturally occurs. I've heard it's painless, which is a slight consolation.

	\section{Colour of Complexes}

		\subsection{Overview}

			As one might be aware, many complex ions are brightly coloured. Examples include \ch{[Cu(H2O)6]^2+}, which is pale blue,
			\ch{[Cu(NH2)4(H2O)2]^2+}, which is dark blue, and \ch{[Fe(SCN)(H2O)5]^2+}, which is blood red.

			There are a number of reasons for this, which will be explored below.

		% end subsection


		\subsection{Quantum Theory of Light}

			What must first be explored is the quantum theory of light. It states that light consists of discrete particles --- \itl{photons}.
			When a photon interacts with an electron, it must be \itl{completely} absorbed, in a one-to-one interaction. All of the energy of
			the photon must be absorbed at once, or not at all.

			Next, electrons in atomic orbitals can only have certain, \itl{fixed} energy levels. Thus, for an electron to absorb the energy
			of an oncoming photon, the energy of the photon must correspond \itl{exactly} to a valid \itl{energy gap} in the orbitals of
			the atom.

			The energy of a photon is given as such:

			\diagram[1.5]{
				\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
					$E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$
				\schemestop
			}{\vspace{-1em}}

			$E$ is the energy of the photon, $h$ is the Planck Constant (\SI{6.63e-34}{\square\metre\kilo\gram\per\second}), $c$ is
			the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon.

			As one might know, the wavelength of light corresponds to the \itl{colour} of that light. Hence, the energy of a photon depends
			on its colour.

			The wavelengths of visible light lie between \SI{400}{\nano\metre} and \SI{700}{\nano\metre}. Red has the longest wavelength,
			followed by orange, yellow, green, blue, then violet, at \SI{700}{\nano\metre}.

			Crystal field theory, or CFT, is a theory that attempts to explain the reason for coloured complex ions. The primary idea
			underlying CFT is that complexes are formed because of an electrostatic attraction between the metal cation, and the lone
			pairs of electrons.

			The 5 d-orbitals have the following shapes in 3d space:

			\imgdiagram{110mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/d_orbitals.png}{The 5 orbitals in the d subshell.}

			For an octahedral complex, the ligands will approach along the \itl{x}, \itl{y}, and \itl{z} axes. Thus, they directly approach
			the lobes of the \itl{d\sbs{z\sps{2}}} and \itl{d\sbs{x\sps{2-}}\sbs{y\sps{2}}} orbitals, leaving the lobes of the \itl{d\sbs{yz}},
			\itl{d\sbs{xz}}, and \itl{d\sbs{xy}} orbitals between the ligands.

			A theoretically free transition metal ion has 5 \itl{degenerate} d-orbitals, that are all at the same energy level. However, due
			to their arrangement in space, the electrostatic repulsion between the ligands' lone pairs, and \itl{some} of the d-orbitals,
			leads to a \itl{splitting} of the orbitals, and a loss of degeneracy.

			\imgdiagram{110mm}{../figures/inorganic/ch04/electron_splitting.png}{The 5 degenerate orbitals are split, into 2 and 3.}

			Note that the 2 higher energy orbitals correspond to those where there is electrostatic repulsion with the ligand, and the lower
			3 are the orbitals between the axes.

			\subsubsection{d-d Electronic Transition}

				Going back to the quantum theory of light, a d-d electronic transition can occur when an electron in the lower-energy orbitals
				\itl{absorbs} the energy of a photon corresponding to $∆E$, and is \itl{promoted} to the higher-energy orbital.

				Hence, on average, the photons that pass through the complex molecule will be \itl{missing} that particular wavelength of
				light, so the colour of the complex will appear to be the \itl{complementary colour} of the one absorbed.

				The complements of colours are below.

				\begin{bulletlist}
					& Yellow / Violet
					& Red / Green
					& Orange / Blue
				\end{bulletlist}

				Conveniently, the value of $∆E$ for many complexes lie within the wavelength of visible light, so many of them appear
				coloured.

				If $∆E$ lies beyond that, then d-d electronic transitions will still occur (absorption of UV light for example),
				but human eyes cannot detect them.

		\subsection{Charge-Transfer}

			Other than d-d electronic transfers, charge transfers --- LMCT, or ligand-to-metal charge transfer, and MLCT, metal-to-ligand
			charge transfers --- can also be the cause of coloured ions.

			Notice that in \ch{MnO4-}, the central \ch{Mn} atom is at a +7 oxidation state, and has \itl{no} d-electrons. Hence, d-d electronic
			transitions cannot be the cause of its \itl{intense} purple colour. Instead, LMCT is the cause.

			Similar concepts apply, including the quantum theory of light. Instead of $∆E$ being the difference in energy of the split
			d-orbitals, it is now the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the donor, and the lowest unoccupied
			molecular orbital of the acceptor.

			In other words, it is the first electron affinity of the acceptor less the first ionisation energy of the donor, plus corrections
			for electrostatic interactions.

			\diagram[1.5]{
				\schemestart[0,1.0,thick]
					$∆E = E_{A} - E_{I} + J$
				\schemestop
			}{\vspace{-1em}}

			Due to certain reasons which limit the kinds of electrons that can be promoted in a d-d electronic transition, the intensity of
			absorption for complexes whose colour depends on d-d transitions is usually small --- hence most of the colours are somewhat
			less intense.

			However, these restrictions (involving the quantum state of the electron) do not apply for charge transfers, so the intensity
			of light absorbed is much greater, leading to much more intense colours in these complexes.

		\subsection{Factors Affecting Complex Colours}

			\subsubsection{Oxidation State of Cation}

				The oxidation state of the central metal atom will affect the number of electrons present in the d-subshell. This will thus
				affect the energy level of the orbitals in question, thus changing the value of $∆E$.

				Note that \ch{Sc^3+}, \ch{Ti^4+}, \ch{Cu+} and \ch{Zn^2+} are not coloured, even though titanium and copper are transition metals,
				because they either have fully-filled d-subshells, or empty d-subshells. The subshells are, in the case of titanium and copper,
				partially filled in other oxidation states.

			% end subsubsection


			\subsubsection{Nature of Ligand}

				The nature of the ligand will also affect the value of $∆E$. The bonds within the ligands themselves can affect the energy
				level of the lone pair of electrons, and thus change the degree of electrostatic repulsion faced by the orbitals.
