\section{ Functional Groups }
\subsection{ Overview }

Functional groups are the main determinant of the chemical properties of a molecule. Molecules with the
same functional group are of the same \textit{family} and similar \textit{chemical properties}.

Functional groups can be any size –– the ketone functional group is just an oxygen bonded to a carbon atom
in any position, while the carboxylic acid functional group has a more complex structure.

\subsection{ Basic Functional Groups }

Note that this table is ordered based on the \textit{priority} of the functional group, in terms of where it appears in
an IUPAC-named chemical compound.
